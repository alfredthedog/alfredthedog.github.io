    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio! I want to highlight the experiences I have with libraries and metadata on this website.</h1>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This website will show the experience I’ve gotten working at a public library creating and implementing their fiber arts programming. I want to show the content I’m working on for the summer, when the library has the most engagement from our patrons. I also want to show the experience I’m getting from my internship with the Library of Congress working with metadata. In this first round of assignments, I’m reviewing and editing already made content, and my role will expand as the semester continues. I want this to be a continuous effort that I will work on going into the graduate school program. </p>
