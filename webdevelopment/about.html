    <h1>Temp.</h1>
    <p>My name is Alex Holmes, and I have always wanted to be a librarian. We can and should blame 1999's hit classic The Mummy for this incurable ailment of mine. It could also be because of my grandmother. Who actually was a high school librarian, but who's to say? I am getting my interdisciplinary studies degree at Mizzou, with my components in information technology, international studies, and psychology. I want to work with metadata and even have an internship with the LOC working with it now. In the fall I will be in a Master of Library and Information Science program, hopefully Mizzou's. I work in a public library as a library clerk. I oversee our fiber arts programming, usually crochet, another life-long passion. When I'm not giving myself eyestrain or early arthritis in my hands, I go hiking with my dog. He is a Shiba Inu named Alfred.</p>
